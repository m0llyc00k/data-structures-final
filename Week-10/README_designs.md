<h2> Designs for Final Projects </h2>
<h3><b>Molly Cook</b> ///// Data Structures, Fall 2021</h3>
<h4>
What will the visualization look like? Will it be interactive? If so, how? <br>
How will the data need to be mapped to the visual elements? <br>
For that mapping, what needs to be done to the data? Be specific and clear. Will it require filtering, aggregation, restructuring, and/or something else? How will this be done? <br>
What is the default view (if any)? <br>
What assumptions are you making about the user? <br>

<h3>Redesign of AA Website</h3>
I am looking to utilized a map to show the meetings themselves and where they are located. On the column to the right, there are various important filters to filter what you need from a meeting. On the bottom, a row will be there to show you the meeting you've selected once you click it on the map. All of the remaining details along with the address and directions will be there to view.

<h3>Bread Diary</h3> 
<p>In this database, bread 'type' (wheat or white) is the primary key and 'time spent' is the secondary key. By filtering the 2, you will pull up an entry that shows the data within that entry (name, ingredients, result recordings) as well as the drawing of the bread. I hope to integrate some aesthetic elements that are hand drawn within the viz itself to make it all feel like my real bread journal does.</p>

<h3>Sensor Data: Sleep, Interrupted</h3>
<p>Using the data that I will take from the sensor, I will record and map each 24 hour period of the temperature in my bedroom and show the results in the context of my sleep patterns. The furnace in my room gets so hot and dry, I inevitably wake up and open the window, causing the temperature to drop. I hope to show small multiples to reveal a pattern, and maybe do an average scale to show it all at a glance. </p>
