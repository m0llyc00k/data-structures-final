<h1>Data Structures - Fall 2021</h1>
<h2>author: Molly Cook</h2>
    <h3>description</h3>
    <p>'week02.js' breaks down the data found in 'm01.txt' and extracts just the address from each meeting. It begins by pulling every td tag, narrowing down those that have the style 'border-bottom:1px solid #e3e3e3; width:260px', and then uses replace, split, and slice to eliminate any additional information that is not part of the address.</br>
    The file then creates a file called 'addresses_m01.txt' in the 'data' folder.</p>
    
   <p><b>cheerio</b> was used in this process</p>
