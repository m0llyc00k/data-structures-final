<em>Assignment 2

Part One: Plan
Using the Hills text as a starting point (but feel free to strike out on your own), draw a data model for your "Process Blog" data to be stored in this database table. Include all the content/data/variables from your "Process Blog" project that you believe to be relevant. Upload an image (png format) of your drawing to your GitHub repository.

Some decisions that will help with this drawing:

Will you use a Normalized Data Model or a Denormalized Data Model? Why?
When the data comes back out of the database, how should it be structured? Why?
How would you describe the hierarchy of the data?</em>

<b>My concept for this project came from a bread journal I started keeping a couple of years ago. Each time I bake bread, I create a detailed entry including temperature, time, ingredients, outcome, drawing etc.
I'd like to use this data/ format to structure these entries below:</b>

Part Two: Create some data and test its fit in Word
Using Word, populate three dummy NoSQL database entries that represent various plausible Process Blog entries (it's ok to use Lorem Ipsum for the text).

Submission requirements
Update your GitHub repository with the relevant files; for this week, this should include the image/PDF of your (non)schema design and also your three Word files. In Canvas, submit the URL of the specific location of this work within your data-structures GitHub repository.
