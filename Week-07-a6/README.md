<b>Part 1 -- AA data</b> </br>
First, we used the starter code to select the data we have so far from the AA website and input it into a table. I had to input my credentials again, then selected the data I had so far from 'aalocations' in order to create the table.

See table here in the console:

<b>Part 2 -- Process Blog Continued</b> </br>
Before starting with this process, I updated the table in for my process blog. I changed pk to 'bread type' and sk to 'totalTimeHours'. I also added additional entries so that I had 8 total.

Then, I used the starter code here. I queried for wheat bread that took between 7 and 16 hours.
